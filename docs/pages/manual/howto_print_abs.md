## Printing parts

### What material should I use?
ZeroG printers are designed to be printed using ABS(+), ASA or [TitanX](https://www.formfutura.com/shop/product/titanx-2846){:target="_blank"}. This means we've included tollerances for material shrinkage in our models.
It's recommended to print your ABS(+), ASA or [TitanX](https://www.formfutura.com/shop/product/titanx-2846){:target="_blank"} parts inside of an enclosure, this will greatly increase layer strenght.

#### The difference between ABS, ABS+, ASA and TitanX
A quote from [https://all3dp.com/](https://all3dp.com/2/abs-plus-filament-what-is-it/){:target="_blank"} 
> "ABS+, or ABS Plus, aims to reduce the sensitivity to shrinkage and warping of ABS, while preserving most of its performance advantages."

#### How to print ABS
An awesome user from the [Voron](https://vorondesign.com){:target="_blank"} community (and YouTube) that goes by the name of [NERO 3D](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmV40QWkVeRs_nAvEOE_P-g){:target="_blank"} has created a Tips and Tricks playlist on how to print abs. I strongly advise you to checkout his video series before you attempt to print ABS(+).
