# Printers
So far we have one awesome printer! The Mercury One, however the next ituration of the Mercury One is ready! It's called Mercury One.1.

## Difference
Whats the difference [Mercury One](/docs/bom/mercury/one) / [Mercury One.1](/docs/bom/mercury/one) ?

### Mercury One
This uses a Voron [Afterburner](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Afterburner){:target="_blank"}, with our older stepper motor mounts (chunky boys).

### Mercury One.1
This is using the [EVA 2.3](https://main.eva-3d.page/){:target="_blank"} system. 
#### What is this EVA thing?
EVA is a carriage platform for MGN rail based printers. The main goal is to support what people may have laying around or have easy access to. EVA is trying to implement that goal.

#### Changes:
1. We've modified the frontplate to fit our belt path.
2. A new revision of the x_joints they're lighter and smaller (Fasterrr!!).
3. Smaller stepper motor mounts (credit card sized).
