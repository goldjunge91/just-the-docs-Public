# Sourcing Guide

[Here](/docs/bom/mercury/one) you'll find a listing of all the parts & compontents you need to build your own ZeroG printer.


## Tested by humans
About 90% of the parts listed on the Bill of Materials have been tested by the developers. If you find something isn't working, please do tell us. We'd like to add that we're not responsible if parts do not fit.
